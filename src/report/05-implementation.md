# Implementation

When we set out to accomplish a successful implementation to achieve maximum
market value in the minimum time to market we were faced with a few decisions in
how to implement our project. What is the goal of our initial users? Are we
helping them and, by extension, their world if we fulfill our mission? What is
our mission? What does a user's journey look like?

After thorough discussion and analysis we decided on the core features that
would better the lives of our users: creating a plan, knowing what plans are
available, and, last but not least, joining an existing event. These happened to
be the minimal steps for our users to achieve their goal of sharing their happy
hour plans with their coworkers.

What came out of this process was a functioning bot on the Slack platform which
responded to real commands. UX sessions can be found in our Google Drive
folder: [Joe], [Matt], and [Danny].

We built a bot which responded to some basic commands that allowed users to meet
IRL. Full code implementation can be found on [Github].
