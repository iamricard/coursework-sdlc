# Testing

In this sequence of sessions we had two major chunks. In the first one we tried
to validate our idea without a working implementation in code. The second
consisted of taking all the lessons learned from the first session and have a
full working bot that implemented the basic needs of our users.

In our first attempt at proving our idea a member of the team simply changed
their Slack profile to mimick that of a bot. They named themselves `lunchbot`,
changed their picture and statement to something more _bot-like_, and stopped
participating in conversations unless summoned. That helped us gather feedback
on the interface we thought we would implement to interact with the bot, along
with collecting additional features that the test users considered a
_nice-to-have_.

After reflecting on the feedback from the first session we implemented a bot and
tested that with more precision. In the second round we recorded people's
screens as we asked them to complete a journey. We noticed our concept of
"technically proficient", and what that meant for interacting with our user,
needed to be refined. For the recorded UX sessions please refer to links:
