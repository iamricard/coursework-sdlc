# Analysis

Some of the organizers of the session encouraged the different teams to come up
with solutions to problems they were facing in their everyday life. In our case
there was a problem we encountered consistently with our colleagues and
classmates. We had a hard time organizing activities with co-workers outside of
work hours. Major issues encountered included: platform fragmentation, hard to
track plans, attendees and their updates, no interface designed to generate
plans in common environments.

Given our experience working we decided a good MVP to prove our idea would be a
simple bot built on the already successful Slack model.
