# Evaluation

If I had to name one thing to take away from this experience, it could be
distilled in the following sentence:

> Test early, and test often.

That is something we would've benefited from doing. We failed to test some
assumptions in the beginning and it came back to haunt us in our sessions. Had
this been a real commercial project with real stakeholders, the fact that our
bot's discoverability and help command were unintuitive to our users would've
most likely delayed launch, and cost us a lot of money in the process.

I also benefited from learning about user journeys and how to map them. That
was a truly enlightening experience, and it made coming up with user stories a
much more trivial task.

In terms of the coding itself, I think we did a great job at distributing the
ownership of the codebase. We achieved that by having sessions of what is
commonly referred to as [mob programming].
