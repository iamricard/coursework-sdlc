# Introduction

The goal of this project was to put in practice the concepts and ideas covered
in the SDLC module. A brief summary includes, but is not limited to, the
following ideas:

*   [User Research]
*   [Agile Methodologies]
*   [Lean Startup]
*   [User stories]

All of these concepts are very much intertwined and do not work exclusively of
each other. They are however, complementary to each other and important on their
own right.
