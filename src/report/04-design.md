# Design

The first part of our design process was to define who our initial users would
be, everything would derive from that. Our decision was to focus on
_professionals who use Slack for communication at work_. It is important to
highlight that we did consider other platforms, like HipChat and Telegram or
Facebook's Messenger, and there is little stopping us from extending our bot to
support multiple platforms. The main reason driving our choice of Slack as a
pioneer platform was the ease of access to an already existing large user base
on our end.

After conducting surveys, creating two personas and their corresponding user
journeys, and going through user testing on mocked bots, we distilled our ideas
and dreams into a small subset of features:

*   Creating and deciding on a plan
*   Being able to list all existing plans
*   Update plans as they change
